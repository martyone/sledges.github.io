## Sailfish SDK Toolchain

### Scratchbox 2

Sailfish SDK builds on the Scratchbox 2 cross-compilation toolkit.
Scratchbox 2 solves the problem of cross-compilation by creating a
virtual development environment that looks like a target system while
allowing execution of both target-compatible and host-compatible
binaries transparently (where "host" means the machine where software is
built).

Scratchbox 2 achieves this by employing target CPU emulation and by
composing a single virtual file system view from four physical
locations:

  - Host filesystem
      - Contains Scratchbox 2 itself
      - Contains generic (as opposite to target-specific) tools (e.g SCM
        tools, build automation tools, code editors)
      - Host-compatible binaries

<!-- end list -->

  - Tools distribution
      - Contains target-specific tools (e.g. cross-compiler toolchain)
      - Host-compatible binaries

<!-- end list -->

  - Target device filesystem image
      - Target-compatible binaries

<!-- end list -->

  - User's working directory
      - Contains source code and build artefacts
      - Target-compatible binaries

The existence of the Tools distribution concept enables development for
different target operating systems within single SDK installation.

Here is how the terms native to Scratchbox 2 map to the terms used in
Sailfish SDK:

| Scratchbox 2                   | Sailfish SDK           |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Host filesystem                | SDK Build Engine       |
| Tools distribution             | SDK Build Tooling (\*) |
| Target device filesystem image | SDK Build Target       |

(\*) The word "tooling" is used instead of "tools" simply for the
possibility to distinguish single from multiple.

### Build Tools

The cross-compilation toolchain consists of Linaro GCC, the GNU ld
linker and GNU libc, run within a ScratchBox 2 virtual machine within
the SDK Build Engine. As described before, a single Sailfish SDK
installation can include multiple SDK Build Targets. Any particular
build target is used to perform builds for a specific HW architecture
(e.g., armv7, i586, etc) and OS version. You can check to see which
version of the build tools are installed for a given architecture and OS
version by checking the version of the cross-\[arch\]-gcc and
cross-\[arch\]-binutils packages under the corresponding SDK Build
Tooling.

For example:
```
$ sfdk tools list
Sailfish OS-4.1.0.24              sdk-provided,latest
├── Sailfish OS-4.1.0.24-aarch64  sdk-provided,latest
├── Sailfish OS-4.1.0.24-armv7hl  sdk-provided,latest
└── Sailfish OS-4.1.0.24-i486     sdk-provided,latest
$ sfdk tools exec Sailfish OS-4.1.0.24 zypper info cross-armv7hl-gcc
...
Name           : cross-armv7hl-gcc
Version        : 8.3.0-1.2.7.jolla
...
```

It is this version of GCC which will be available within a build shell
when the corresponding build target is used.

For example:
```nosh
$ sfdk config --push target Sailfish OS-4.1.0.24-armv7hl
$ sfdk build-shell
[Sailfish OS-4.1.0.24-armv7hl] ~ $ gcc -v
...
gcc version 8.3.0 20190222 (Sailfish OS gcc 8.3.0-3) (Linaro GCC 8.2-2018.08~dev)
```

Note that to build packages, the build-shell prompt is not usually
necessary as the `sfdk build` and related commands perform all the
necessary steps to build and package a project for the developer.

### Other Tools

There are tools that are not meant to be used from the build shell,
i.e., under Scratchbox 2. This is also the case of higher level tools
which themselves use Scratchbox 2, like `mic` for image creation and
`osc` for OBS integration. These tools are available directly from the
build engine shell:
```nosh
$ sfdk engine exec mic ...
```

## Android BSP Support

Sailfish OS utilises [libhybris](https://github.com/libhybris) to
leverage existing Android board support packages and allow using
libraries and binary-only device drivers built with the Android
toolchain to be used within Sailfish OS.
