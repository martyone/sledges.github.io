First of all - thank you\! Contributions to the wiki are very welcome :)

The Sailfish OS Documentation should be a reliable and accurate source
of information and it's important that we work together to ensure this.
What this means in practice is that we all need to follow some
guidelines for docs contributions.

  - **Search:** There's a lot of content in the docs and in the [API
    Documentation](https://sailfishos.org/develop/docs) - make sure the
    information you want to contribute isn't mentioned elsewhere. If it
    is then strongly consider including a suitable link instead (and by
    'strongly consider' we're just being polite - don't duplicate
    information\!)
  - **Where:** The Sailfish OS Documentation is divided into two areas:
    support/integration content and reference content. The docs should
    be used for guidance documentation (this is typically conversational
    and gives a high level explanation). Detailed reference information
    and anything more than minimal code snippets usually belongs in or
    near the source code - see the [API Documentation
    Contributions](/API_Documentation_Contributions "brokenlink") page for
    more about that.
  - **Location:** Think carefully about where your content belongs - if
    in doubt, raise an [issue in the docs Git
    repo](https://github.com/sledges/sledges.github.io/issues).
    Especially if you are planning to change the nav structure.
  - **Consistency:** Below are some links to templates or check pages.
    These are intended to both provide some consistency to similar pages
    and to remind you what kind of content should be included.
  - **Public:** Contributions are public and will be published using the
    licence shown at the bottom of each docs page. Once information is
    published it cannot be reliably deleted from the internet so please
    bear that in mind. Changes are also stored (and linked to your
    account) in the git commit logs - make sure you're happy with all
    this.
  - **Style:** The Sailfish OS Documentation style is conversational and
    friendly - don't try to make things sound too formal and technical,
    the OS is complicated enough as it is\! On the other hand be
    accurate and use the correct technical terms where it makes sense -
    you're talking to the other competent engineers, not pointy-haired
    managers ;)
  - **Legal:** be aware of licences and copyright. You should only add
    content you create or can attribute under a suitable licence.

Having said all that:

  - **Add:** Get typing - think about who's reading your work and ensure
    it's appropriate and relevant.
  - **Improve:** If you know something is missing, mistyped, or
    misleading then please fix it. If you aren't confident then feel
    free to reach out to us and make sure you've got your facts right -
    this is really important work and as a bonus if you say to someone
    "I checked the docs and still don't quite understand - explain it to
    me and I'll improve the documentation," then you're likely to get a
    lot more help.

There are a few areas of the site that should be pretty consistent so
we've started a list of checklists for contributing documentation on:
