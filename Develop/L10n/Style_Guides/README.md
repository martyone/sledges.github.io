Having a style guide massively improves translations for a given
language, consistency, mood, voice, you name it. We strongly encourage
all Sailfish OS languages to have one.

Existing style guides are [listed
here](/Develop/L10n#style). Guides of existing community
languages progress is in this [TJC
post](https://together.jolla.com/question/145988/official-announcement-contribute-language-style-guides-not-a-question/).

To create a guide for a new language, please take e.g. [English (United
Kingdom)](/Develop/L10n/Style_Guides/English_\(United_Kingdom\)) as
reference, by copying [its
source](https://github.com/sledges/sledges.github.io/blob/master/Develop/L10n/Style_Guides/English_\(United_Kingdom\)/README.mdpp)
to your own `.../Style_Guides/Your_Language/README.mdpp`.

Then start shaping its contents to match your language grammar and
culture.

You'll see existing style guides peppered with templates for maximum
re-use, e.g.
```
!INCLUDE "../Templates/Grammar_voice.mdpp"
For example:
* Correct: '''Create Account Settings in...'''
* Incorrect: '''Account Settings are created in...'''
```

If your language has a different rule than the template says (e.g.
passive voice preferred over active), simply replace with [template's
source](https://github.com/sledges/sledges.github.io/blob/master/Develop/L10n/Style_Guides/Templates/Grammar_voice.mdpp):
```
== Voice ==
Whenever possible, use the passive voice. Keep the message clear and the sentences short

For example:
* Correct: '''<an example of passive voice in your language>'''
* Incorrect: '''<an example of active voice in your language>'''
```

Then carry on through all other sections in the same fashion. If you
have doubts, post in [SFOS
Forum](https://forum.sailfishos.org/c/localisation/20) to consult the
fellow speakers. If you feel like some sections are not relevant or lack
information, it's ok to skip them, someone else will complement them in
the future.

Finally, test and submit your contribution as per [documentation
instructions](https://github.com/sledges/sledges.github.io/blob/master/README.md).
