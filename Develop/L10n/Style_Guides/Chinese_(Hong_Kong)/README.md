# Style guidelines and principles

This document provides generic style guidelines for Sailfish OS. The
target audience for this documentation is everyone translating Sailfish
OS-related material. The goal is to create contemporary translations
that provide a high-quality user experience.

Sailfish OS audience and target group for the translations is young,
active users accustomed to social media and therefore its language.

# Basics of good writing style

  - Write in a personal style, engaging and involving the user.
  - Use active style and present tense. Use imperatives and talk to the
    user.
  - Make sure the text is consistent and clear and correct in grammar
    and spelling.
  - Write in short sentences.
  - Use a positive tone, avoid negative expressions.
  - Avoid ambiguity. Make sure that pronouns point clearly to the
    relevant nouns, and avoid long strings of modifiers or nouns.

Remember we are sailing on a jolly boat. Have fun\! Play with the
language. Be innovative and guide the readers onto a journey. Do not
attempt to use humor, but use fresh and fun tone where it naturally
fits. Remember that the most important part is delivering a clear
message.

Note that in technical writing, descriptions and instructions should not
include text that is written from a marketing point of view.

# Language and culture

Because our communication is targeted to international use and part of
it will be translated, try to keep the language culturally unambiguous,
be careful of religious references, and avoid using idiomatic
expressions or slang. The key aspects are clarity and simplicity.
Consider these targets when adapting the jolly tone to the texts. In
software UI translations: Respect the source text, but do not create
word for word translations. Take the context into account when
translating.

# Grammar

## Person

Please try to be informal if that feels natural in your language. Avoid
mentioning pronouns.

Keep addressing consistent: e.g. if a paragraph was started using the
second person, retain it throughout all its sentences (as opposed to
switching to third person or neutral mood).

## Tense

Use the present tense.
For example:

  - Correct: Media player selects songs: **媒體播放器會選擇歌曲**
  - Incorrect: Media player will select songs: **媒體播放器將會選擇歌曲**

Follow the tense of the source language.
For example: Configuring your system...: **正在配置系统...**

## Voice

Whenever possible, use the active voice. Keep the message clear and the
sentences short.

For example:

  - Correct: Create Account Setting: **建立帳戶設定**
  - Incorrect: Account Settings are created: **帳戶設定被建立**

## Mood

Use the imperative form.

For example:

  - Correct: Go to Settings: '''轉至設定 '''
  - Incorrect: User goes to Settings: **用戶轉至設定**

## Capitalisation

Capitalise application names and company names.

In the UI, start the first word with a capital letter.

Respect capitalisation rules of the language in question.

## Menu style in the UI

User Interface menu items are named using verbs.

## Empty states in the UI

User Interface empty states are typically written in the 2-sentence
form, using verbs and active tone and, where possible, guiding the user
towards the next possible steps to take. Keep sentences short and
content informative. Where possible, guide user to reflect the good
sides of an application or service (like referring to friends instead of
contacts in the People app). For example:\
(tell the situation, what items are missing) (point user to next actions)\
No contacts yet. Pull down to add your friends.

App covers (that are shown in the Home) for empty states aim to be short
informative messages. Length is typically two words.

# Punctuation

In Chinese, always use the double-byte punctuation.

## End punctuation

In UI strings, do not use a full stop at the end of a sentence if
there’s only one sentence. If there are two or more sentences, use
full stops normally.

If the segment ends with the colon or ellipsis, the translation should
follow the source.

## Abbreviations

In technical writing, use common abbreviations. Do not use Latin
abbreviations.

In the UI, use common abbreviations, including Latin abbreviations. Make
sure text clarity does not suffer. If in doubt, do not use an
abbreviation.

Do not use a full stop in or after acronyms or initialisms, e.g.:

  - Correct: **WLAN**
  - Incorrect: **W.L.A.N.**

Do not use a full stop with unit (measurement) symbols, e.g.:

  - Correct: **kg**
  - Incorrect: **kg.**

Use a full stop with Latin abbreviations, e.g.:

  - Correct: **e.g., ca., etc.**
  - Incorrect: **eg, ca, etc**

## Contractions

Do not use contractions (e.g. aren't, should've) in technical writing.

In the UI, contractions can be used when needed if the space is limited.
Make sure that information given to the user is not lost because of such
shortcuts.

Before using a contraction, try to rephrase the text so that contraction
can be avoided. Omit words that are not essential for delivering the
message clearly. If contracting cannot be avoided, minimize the number
of words contracted. It is better to contract one word more than to
contract several words a little.

## Plurals

Change the plural form of abbreviations to the singular one.
For example: This product is shipped with several CD-ROMs: **本产品随带了若干个
CD-ROM。**

## Quotation marks

Respect language's quotation rules. A comprehensive list of marks can be
found here:
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quotation_mark#Summary_table_for_various_languages>

## Lists

In technical writing, write lists with bullets.

In the UI, write lists without bullets or colons.

## Headings

In technical writing, create structured, consistent and accurate
headings. Consider verb structures in headings.

## Text modules

In technical writing, make sure each module can be read independently,
containing all the needed information so that modules do not need to be
read in any certain order.

## Procedures

In technical writing, when describing procedures, make sure to describe
the steps clearly with only one task per step. Describe the expected
results of those steps.

# Numerals

## Numbers

Write numbers as digits, including numbers below 10.

For example:

  - Correct:1 message received: **收到了 1 個訊息。**
  - Incorrect: One message received: **收到了一個訊息。**

Write numbers as Chinese digits if they are idioms or set phrases. E.g.
**一清二楚**

Write numbers as Chinese digits if two consecutive numbers are written
together for approximate numbers. E.g. **二三十米**

## Measurements

Use numerals for measurements.

Use a space between the numeral and the unit, except with degree and
percentage sign. E.g.:

  - Correct: **5 cm, 20°, 20 °C**
  - Incorrect: **5cm, 20 °, 20°C**

# Terminology

Sailfish OS has a separate Terminology project to maintain consistency.
Use that approved terminology when available.

## Company names

Do not translate company names unless there is an official, translated
name available.

## Product names and trademarks

Do not translate product names or trademarks.

## Safety information and legal texts

Warnings, cautions, and notes are legal texts that need to be confirmed
with legal department. In case of legal texts, follow the instructions
carefully and ask for more information if needed.

| exclamation mark      | single-byte | No space between it and the Chinese character before it.<br/>A space between it and the sentence after it.           |

Use single-byte parentheses to enclose shortcut keys and leave no space
between Chinese characters and parentheses. For example:

  - \&File: **文件(\&F)**
  - About \&ABC: **关于 ABC(\&A)**
  - &50%: **50%(&5)**
  - \&Font…: **字体(\&F)…**
  - Le\&ft: **左(\&F)**

# Special instructions for technical writing

When translating UIs in documentation (or other technical writing),
always follow its terminology for consistency.

Spacing rules:

  - There should be a space between Chinese characters and single-byte
    characters (such as English characters, numbers and single-byte
    punctuation).
  - There should be no space before and after double-byte punctuation,
    including Chinese parentheses.

# Checklist

When finalising translations for the UI, check the following:

  - Everything has been translated to your best knowledge.
  - Spell check is done.
  - Check consistency with the other translations done for the language.
  - Ensure correct Sailfish OS terminology is used. If needed, propose
    new term entries.
  - Confirm legal texts are consistent with the source.
  - Company and product names, trademarks, symbols, and measurements
    have not been hyphenated.
  - Ensure regional formats are retained, such as date, time, numeric
    and quotation literals.

When finalising texts for the technical writing, check these points as
well:

  - Titles and headings are structured and accurate.
  - Language is clear and consistent.
  - Sentences vary in length and have a clear form.
