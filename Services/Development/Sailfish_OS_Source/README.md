## Finding the Source for a Package

There are a variety of ways to determine the location of the source repository for a particular package:

  - search the git trees mentioned in the table above
  - search the [Core Areas and APIs](/Reference/Core_Areas_and_APIs) documentation to find the appropriate repository
  - look hints on the device, e.g.:

If you have developer mode installed, via command line you can search for more detailed information. For example searching packages by name:
```nosh
pkcon search name browser
```

... and after finding the package name you can get more details:
```nosh
pkcon get-details sailfish-browser
```

Same actions can be done also with zypper (zypper not included by default, and needs to be installed, with `devel-su pkcon -p install zypper`)
```nosh
devel-su zypper se browser
devel-su zypper info sailfish-browser
```

If you want to know which package a file belongs to you can check with `rpm` the package name:
```nosh
rpm -qf /etc/gps.conf
```

If all other means fail and the package name is known, the contributor can search for it on an available [OBS](/Services/Development/Open_Build_Service) instance and then examine that package's `_service` file to determine the source code repository.
